# tte

A bare minimum terminal text editor. (Severely incomplete)

## Features

- `Ctrl + q` : Quit

## Missing Features

- Status Line
- Editing
- ...

## Known Bugs

- Sometimes, when pressing up arrow, the cursor will randomly get stuck, and will not go futher up until you press left or right.
- The x, y calculation is messed up for non-zero start position for buffers

## Notice

This is an educational project for me to learn how to build a text editor. This is not meant to be used as your main text editor. I will probably not make this feature complete.
